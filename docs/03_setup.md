# Setup Guide

This guide walks you through the process of setting up the Human-AI Collaboration Framework for your first project. Following these steps will help you establish a solid foundation for effective collaboration.

## Preparation

Before beginning setup, take some time to:

1. **Review the framework basics**
   - Read through the [Basics document](/docs/01_basics.md)
   - Understand your role in the collaboration
   - Familiarize yourself with core concepts

2. **Consider your project needs**
   - Think about your project goals and scope
   - Identify key challenges you anticipate
   - Consider your working preferences
   - Reflect on what success looks like

3. **Prepare your working environment**
   - Set up a comfortable space for focused work
   - Ensure access to your preferred AI platform
   - Organize any existing project materials
   - Schedule uninterrupted time for initial setup

## Core Setup Process

The setup process focuses on establishing three fundamental components that will support all your subsequent work.
After deciding on an AI platform you wish to you, ensure that the AI you wish to enter a cooperative relationship with has access to all files from the Process and Initialisation directories at least. Depending on its context window, giving access to the readme and additional document (like this one) may also be of use. Once all necessary files are uploaded, you are ready to start

### Step 1: Create Your Collaborator Profile

Your Collaborator Profile documents your working preferences, expertise, and learning goals. This helps establish effective collaboration patterns from the beginning.

To create your profile:

1. Start a new conversation with your AI partner
2. Explain that you want to create a Collaborator Profile
3. Work through these key areas:
   - Technical background and expertise
   - Tool proficiency and preferences
   - Working style and cognitive patterns
   - Communication preferences
   - Project-specific expertise
   - Learning objectives

The AI will guide you through this process, asking questions to help document your preferences. Be honest about both your strengths and areas for development.

**Expected time**: 30-45 minutes

### Step 2: Establish Project Foundations

The Project Foundations document defines the core parameters of your project, establishing a clear framework for all subsequent work.

To create your Project Foundations:

1. Start a new conversation (or continue the previous one)
2. Explain that you want to establish Project Foundations
3. Work through these essential elements:
   - Project purpose and scope
   - Key definitions
   - Foundational assumptions
   - Theoretical approach
   - Methodological framework
   - Quality standards
   - Technical infrastructure

The AI will help you document these aspects, asking clarifying questions and helping you articulate your project parameters clearly.

**Expected time**: 45-60 minutes

### Step 3: Develop Engagement Guidelines

Engagement Guidelines document how you and your AI partner will work together, establishing clear patterns for effective collaboration.

To create your Engagement Guidelines:

1. Start a new conversation (or continue the previous one)
2. Explain that you want to develop Engagement Guidelines
3. Work through these key areas:
   - Session structure preferences
   - Communication framework
   - Documentation standards
   - Progress tracking approaches
   - Quality assurance methods
   - Evolution mechanisms

The AI will help you establish guidelines that match your working style while maintaining framework effectiveness.

**Expected time**: 30-45 minutes

## Initial Work Session

After completing the core setup, conduct your first working session to experience the framework in action.

### Session Structure

1. **Begin with clear objectives**
   - Define specific goals for the session
   - Establish expected outcomes
   - Set time parameters

2. **Document using the Session Template**
   - Create a session transfer document
   - Record context and objectives
   - Track progress throughout

3. **End with reflection**
   - Document what you learned
   - Note what worked well
   - Identify improvement opportunities
   - Plan next steps

### Focus Areas for First Session

Keep your first session focused on:

- Testing your established patterns
- Developing a feel for the workflow
- Creating initial project content
- Documenting your experience

**Expected time**: 60-90 minutes

## Next Components

After your initial session, gradually add these components as your work develops:

### Living Questions Document

This document tracks your developing understanding and open questions. Create it when:

- You have initial project content to work with
- Knowledge tracking becomes important
- You need to manage multiple inquiries
- Your understanding begins evolving significantly

### Project Plan

This document organizes your work components and timelines. Develop it when:

- Project structure becomes more complex
- You need to manage multiple workstreams
- Timeline coordination becomes important
- Resource management needs attention

## Practical Implementation

As you implement the framework, remember:

### Start Simple

- Begin with basic implementations of each component
- Add complexity gradually as needed
- Focus on practical effectiveness
- Maintain clear documentation

### Regular Review

Schedule regular review of your framework implementation:

- Weekly brief checks (15-30 minutes)
- Monthly deeper reviews (30-60 minutes)
- Quarterly comprehensive assessment (60-90 minutes)

### Continuous Documentation

Maintain documentation of:

- What works well for you
- Where challenges arise
- How you've modified the framework
- What you're learning about collaboration

## Common Setup Challenges

### Challenge: Feeling Overwhelmed

If the setup process feels overwhelming:

- Focus on one component at a time
- Start with simpler implementations
- Remember you can add sophistication later
- Document what you've completed clearly

### Challenge: Unclear Direction

If you're unsure how to proceed:

- Review framework documentation again
- Focus on practical next steps
- Document specific questions
- Ask your AI partner for guidance

### Challenge: Time Constraints

If you have limited time:

- Start with abbreviated versions of core components
- Focus on most essential elements
- Schedule specific time for framework development
- Build incrementally as you go

## Support Resources

As you set up your framework, remember these resources:

- [Framework documentation](/README.md) for reference
- [Troubleshooting guide](/docs/08_troubleshooting.md) for specific issues
- [Practice guide](/docs/09_practice.md) for developing effective habits
- [Advanced topics](/docs/06_advanced.md) for future development

## Next Steps

After completing initial setup:

1. Conduct your first proper work session
2. Review and refine your approach
3. Add components as needed
4. Develop your collaboration skills

Remember that framework setup is an investment that pays dividends throughout your project. Take the time to establish good foundations, but don't let perfectionism prevent you from getting started with actual work.
