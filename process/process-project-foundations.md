# Process Template: Project Foundations Maintenance

## Purpose
This document defines the ongoing processes for maintaining and evolving the Project Foundations throughout the project lifecycle. It serves as a persistent reference for both regular reviews and event-triggered updates.

## Regular Review Process

### Scheduled Reviews
Conduct comprehensive reviews:
- Monthly for overall alignment check
- Quarterly for deep examination
- Annually for fundamental reassessment

### Review Structure
Each review should examine:
1. Alignment with current project reality
2. Effectiveness of working patterns
3. Adequacy of quality standards
4. Evolution of understanding
5. Integration effectiveness
6. Documentation clarity

## Update Triggers

### Automatic Review Triggers

- Project scope changes
- New stakeholders join
- Major challenges emerge
- Significant insights develop
- Working patterns shift
- Quality issues arise

### Content-Specific Triggers
