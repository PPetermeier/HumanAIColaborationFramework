# Working Files Requirements

## Core Documentation Requirements

Every working file in the project must maintain clear documentation of its relationship to the broader project framework. This documentation serves to maintain project coherence while preserving flexibility in how work is organized and executed.

### Essential Documentation Elements

Each working file must include a header section that documents:

Identity Documentation:
The file must clearly state its purpose and role within the project. This includes explaining what the file contains, why it exists, and how it contributes to project objectives. This documentation helps maintain clear alignment between individual work products and overall project goals.

Relationship Documentation:
The file must explicitly document its connections to other project components. This includes identifying dependencies on other files, noting what components depend on this file, and explaining how the file integrates with the broader project structure. This documentation helps maintain project coherence and supports effective collaboration.

Evolution Documentation:
The file must maintain a clear record of significant changes, including what changed, why it changed, and how these changes affect other project components. This documentation helps track development over time and supports effective project evolution.

### Integration Requirements

Each working file must maintain clear integration with the project framework through:

Project Plan Integration:
The file must document how its contents relate to specific components of the project plan. This includes identifying which project objectives the file supports and how it contributes to their achievement.

Living Questions Integration:
The file must maintain clear connections to relevant aspects of project understanding documented in the Living Questions document. This includes noting which questions or insights the file addresses and how it contributes to knowledge development.

Session Integration:
The file must support effective session work by maintaining sufficient documentation for context reconstruction and progress tracking. This includes ensuring that session transfer documents can effectively reference and track work within the file.

### Quality Requirements

Each working file must maintain quality through:

Clarity Standards:
The file must maintain clear organization and documentation that supports effective collaboration. This includes using clear structure, maintaining appropriate documentation, and ensuring navigability.

Evolution Support:
The file must support effective evolution through clear version tracking, change documentation, and impact assessment. This includes maintaining records that help understand how and why the file has changed over time.

Integration Effectiveness:
The file must maintain effective integration with other project components through clear documentation of relationships and dependencies. This includes ensuring that connections to other components remain current and accurate.

### Practical Implementation

These requirements should be implemented through:

Header Documentation:
Each file should begin with a header section that addresses the essential documentation elements. This section should be easily identifiable and maintained consistently.

Change Tracking:
The file should maintain clear records of significant changes, including their rationale and implications. This documentation should support effective project evolution and knowledge transfer.

Integration Management:
The file should maintain clear documentation of its relationships with other project components. This documentation should support effective collaboration and project coherence.

### Evolution Management

These requirements should evolve through:

Regular Review:
Requirements should be reviewed periodically to ensure they continue to support effective project work while maintaining necessary structure.

Feedback Integration:
User experiences and challenges should inform requirement evolution, ensuring the framework remains practical and effective.

Documentation Updates:
Changes to requirements should be clearly documented and communicated to maintain consistent implementation across the project.

Note: These requirements focus on maintaining essential project integration while preserving flexibility in how individual work is organized and executed. They should be implemented in ways that support rather than hinder effective work.
