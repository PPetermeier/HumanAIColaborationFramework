# Initialization Dialogue Template Specification

## Purpose and Scope

This template guides LLMs through the process of helping users customize the collaboration framework for their specific needs. It ensures systematic coverage of all essential aspects while maintaining flexibility for different project types and scales, with particular attention to managing the process across multiple chat sessions.

## Session Management

### Chat Session Architecture

The initialization process is designed to span multiple focused chat sessions, each with clear objectives and boundaries. This approach allows for:
- Deep focus on specific aspects of customization
- Natural break points for reflection
- Manageable cognitive load for users
- Clear documentation of progress

### Session Transition Protocol

When preparing for a chat transition:

Closing Current Session:
- Summarize key decisions and progress
- Document current state using session template
- Identify specific objectives for next session
- Create clear handoff documentation

Opening New Session:
- Provide previous session summary
- State specific objectives for current session
- Validate understanding of progress so far
- Confirm continuation strategy

### Continuity Documentation

Each transition requires:

State Documentation:
- Decisions made and their rationale
- Current position in setup process
- Pending items and considerations
- Known dependencies and constraints

Next Steps Documentation:
- Specific objectives for next session
- Required preparation or review
- Expected decisions or outcomes
- Potential challenges to address

## Dialogue Structure

### Phase 1: Context Establishment

The LLM should guide the conversation through these key areas:

Project Understanding:
- Primary objectives and scope
- Expected timeline and scale
- Key stakeholders and their roles
- Anticipated challenges and constraints

Working Pattern Assessment:
- User's technical background and expertise
- Preferred communication styles
- Previous collaboration experience
- Available time and interaction patterns

System Requirements:
- Documentation needs and preferences
- Quality assurance requirements
- Progress tracking expectations
- Knowledge transfer needs

### Phase 2: Framework Customization
For each template in the system, the LLM should:

1. Present the template's core purpose and structure
2. Identify customization opportunities based on context
3. Guide user through key decisions about:

    - Content scope and depth
    - Update frequency and triggers
    - Integration points with other templates
    - Evolution tracking approach



### Phase 3: Integration Validation
The LLM should systematically verify:

- Coherence across customized templates
- Preservation of essential relationships
- Completeness of documentation coverage
- Clarity of operational procedures

## Implementation Guidelines
### Dialogue Management
The LLM should:

- Maintain clear progression through phases
- Adapt questioning depth based on user responses
- Document key decisions and their rationale
- Validate understanding at regular intervals

### Customization Principles
When guiding template modifications:

- Preserve core structural elements
- Maintain clear integration points
- Ensure scalability of chosen approaches
- Document customization decisions

### Quality Assurance
Throughout the process, verify:

- Alignment with project objectives
- Consistency across templates
- Practicality of chosen approaches
- Completeness of coverage

## Adaptation Patterns
### Response to Project Scale
For small projects:

- Focus on essential elements
- Simplify documentation requirements
- Maintain key integration points
- Enable easy scaling if needed

For large projects:

- Implement full framework
- Establish clear hierarchies
- Define detailed processes
- Create robust tracking mechanisms

### Common Scenarios
The LLM should recognize and adapt to:

- Research projects
- Software development
- Creative collaborations
- Analysis projects
- Teaching/learning contexts

## Evolution Tracking
### Documentation Requirements
Record for each customization:

- Rationale for changes
- Impact on other templates
- Implementation considerations
- Future adaptation possibilities

### Validation Points
Regular checks for:

- System coherence
- Template effectiveness
- Integration quality
- User satisfaction

## Session Planning Guidelines

### Session Boundaries

Identify natural break points based on:
- Completion of major setup phases
- Logical groupings of related decisions
- User cognitive load and attention span
- Documentation needs and dependencies

### Transition Timing

Choose transition points that:
- Complete coherent units of work
- Allow for natural reflection periods
- Maintain momentum across sessions
- Respect user time constraints

### Documentation Requirements

For each session transition:
- Create clear session summaries
- Document all key decisions
- Identify pending questions
- Specify next steps

## Multi-Session Management

### Progress Tracking

Maintain across sessions:
- Completed customization steps
- Pending decisions and their dependencies
- Evolution of understanding
- Outstanding questions or concerns

### Consistency Maintenance

Ensure across sessions:
- Coherent decision patterns
- Consistent customization approach
- Clear progression logic
- Maintained context awareness

### Knowledge Transfer

Between sessions:
- Document key insights
- Record decision rationale
- Note emerging patterns
- Track assumption evolution
