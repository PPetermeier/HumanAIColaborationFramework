# Living Questions and Insights Document

## Current Understanding Framework

### Core Knowledge State
Capture the current state of project understanding:

Understanding Components:
A systematic organization of what is currently known, structured to show both certainty and uncertainty. This should include theoretical foundations, empirical findings, and methodological insights.

Knowledge Integration:
A clear mapping of how different knowledge components connect and influence each other, showing both strong and tentative relationships.

Uncertainty Areas:
An explicit documentation of known unknowns and their implications for project development.

### Theoretical Framework
Document the current theoretical understanding:

Framework Elements:
A structured presentation of theoretical components, showing how they work together to support project objectives.

Model Development:
A clear record of how theoretical models have evolved and why, including key assumptions and their justification.

### Empirical Connection
Maintain clear links between theory and evidence:

Evidence Framework:
A systematic organization of empirical findings and their relationship to theoretical components.

Validation Status:
Clear documentation of what has been validated and what requires further investigation.
