# Setup Instructions: Collaborator Profile Creation

## Purpose
This document guides LLMs through the initial creation of a user's Collaborator Profile. These instructions are temporary and should be discarded once the profile is established.

## Profile Creation Process

### Initial Engagement
Begin by explaining to the user:
- The purpose of creating a collaborator profile
- How it will support effective collaboration
- The expected time commitment for creation
- The conversation structure they can expect

### Information Gathering Sequence

1. Technical Background
   - Start with open questions about experience and expertise
   - Follow up on specific areas relevant to the project
   - Explore both strengths and areas for growth
   - Document tools and methodologies they're familiar with

2. Working Style
   - Investigate preferred problem-solving approaches
   - Discuss ideal working conditions
   - Explore cognitive patterns and preferences
   - Understand energy management strategies

3. Communication Preferences
   - Determine preferred interaction styles
   - Discuss documentation preferences
   - Understand feedback mechanisms
   - Identify situation-specific adaptations

4. Project Context
   - Connect general preferences to project needs
   - Identify directly relevant experience
   - Establish learning objectives
   - Clarify role expectations

### Implementation Guidelines

When populating the template:
- Use direct quotes where they capture preferences clearly
- Summarize patterns you observe from multiple responses
- Validate your understanding before documenting
- Maintain focus on project-relevant information

### Quality Assurance

Before finalizing:
- Review all sections for completeness
- Validate with user for accuracy
- Ensure clarity of documented preferences
- Verify project-specific relevance

## Session Management

### Single Session Approach
If completing in one session:
- Set clear time expectations
- Take breaks between major sections
- Review and validate as you go
- Complete with full profile review

### Multi-Session Planning
If splitting across sessions:
- Complete logical sections together
- Summarize progress at session ends
- Note specific topics for next session
- Review previous content when resuming

## Completion Checklist

Before concluding setup:
- All template sections completed
- User has validated accuracy
- Integration points identified
- Initial version documented

## Next Steps

Direct the user to:
- Review the completed profile
- Understand the update process (documented separately)
- Know when to expect regular reviews
