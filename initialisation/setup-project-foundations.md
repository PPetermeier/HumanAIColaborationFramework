# Setup Instructions: Project Foundations Creation

## Purpose
This document guides LLMs through establishing the initial Project Foundations document. These instructions are temporary and should be discarded once the foundations are established.

## Preparation Phase

### Context Understanding
Begin by exploring:
- Overall project goals and objectives
- Expected scope and boundaries
- Key stakeholder needs and expectations
- Available resources and constraints
- Critical success factors

### Framework Alignment
Discuss with user:
- Previous project experiences
- Preferred working methods
- Known challenges or concerns
- Desired outcomes
- Quality expectations

## Development Sequence

### Core Framework Development

1. Project Purpose and Scope
   - Start with broad project vision
   - Refine specific objectives
   - Establish clear boundaries
   - Connect purpose to stakeholder needs
   - Validate scope understanding

2. Key Definitions
   - Identify critical terms
   - Develop precise definitions
   - Discuss contextual meanings
   - Address potential ambiguities
   - Document agreed interpretations

3. Foundational Assumptions
   - Surface implicit assumptions
   - Examine working premises
   - Discuss risk implications
   - Plan validation approaches
   - Document uncertainty areas

### Intellectual Framework Establishment

1. Theoretical Foundations
   - Explore relevant frameworks
   - Discuss applicability
   - Examine limitations
   - Document selection rationale
   - Plan integration approach

2. Methodological Approach
   - Review possible methods
   - Evaluate fit for purpose
   - Consider practical constraints
   - Document chosen approaches
   - Plan implementation details

3. Quality Standards
   - Define quality criteria
   - Establish measurement approaches
   - Set review processes
   - Document standards clearly
   - Plan validation methods

### Technical Infrastructure Assessment

1. Knowledge Work Environment
   - Review current tool usage
   - Identify essential capabilities
   - Map tool relationships
   - Document integration needs
   - Plan evolution approach

2. Tool Selection Process
   - Evaluate existing tools
   - Identify capability gaps
   - Consider integration needs
   - Assess learning curves
   - Document selection rationale

3. Integration Architecture
   - Map tool interactions
   - Document workflows
   - Plan data flows
   - Establish conventions
   - Define best practices

### Operational Structure Definition

Guide the user through establishing:
- Working patterns that fit their style
- Documentation approaches that work
- Integration mechanisms that make sense
- Evolution processes that feel sustainable

## Implementation Guidelines

When developing the foundations:
- Use concrete examples to clarify abstract concepts
- Validate understanding frequently
- Document both decisions and rationale
- Maintain focus on practical applicability
- Ensure clarity and accessibility

## Quality Assurance

Before finalizing:
- Review all sections for completeness
- Validate internal consistency
- Check practical applicability
- Verify stakeholder alignment
- Ensure clarity of documentation

## Session Management

### Single Session Approach
If completing in one session:
- Plan for significant time investment
- Take breaks between major sections
- Review and validate progressively
- End with comprehensive review

### Multi-Session Planning
If splitting across sessions:
- Complete logical sections together
- Document progress clearly
- Plan specific next steps
- Review previous work when resuming

## Completion Checklist

Verify:
- All sections are complete
- Internal consistency maintained
- Integration points identified
- Evolution framework established
- Documentation is clear and accessible

## Next Steps

Direct the user to:
- Review the complete foundations
- Understand the update process
- Plan first regular review
- Begin using the framework

Note: These setup instructions should be discarded after successful creation of the Project Foundations document. Ongoing maintenance is guided by the separate Process Template for Project Foundations Updates.
